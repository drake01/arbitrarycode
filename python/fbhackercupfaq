Facebook will not reimburse any fees or expenses related to obtaining a passport.

How do you win?
Point Structure
Each problem is worth a single point. The contestant with the highest score wins. Points scored in one round are used only to determine standing in that round. Points do not carry over from each individual round.

Penalty Time and Ties
If there is a tie in points, the contestant with the lowest penalty time wins.

A competitor's penalty time for a given Round is equal to the sum of the Submission times of the last output that was submitted by the competitor and judged correct for each Problem in the Round (time is measured from the start of the Round).

How does it work?
Duration
There are multiple rounds to the Facebook Hacker Cup. The Qualification Round lasts 72-hours. Online Round 1 lasts 24-hours. Online Round 2 and 3 are each 3-hours long.

Environment
You can use any programming language to solve the problems, using any development environment or text editor, as long as the compiler or interpreter you used for that language is freely available and easy to download and use. Time-limited trials for compilers and interpreters are disallowed. Visual Studio is acceptable as a compiler, since there's a free version of (almost the same) compiler available, Visual Studio Express. Facebook reserves the right to make further exceptions on a case-by-case basis.

The Problems
Each contest consists of 3 algorithmic problems. The problems will be listed in the panel on the top left side of the page. Click on a problemâ€™s name to view the statement for that problem, which will appear in the middle of the page.

The problem statement will be rendered as HTML, possibly containing images. It will include one or more sample test cases and provide links to download input and submit output.

Downloading Input
At the bottom of the problem statement will be a link to download the input file. The timer begins immediately after you start to download the input file. You will have six minutes to upload the output from your program.

You have one chance, to solve the input. You may resubmit during this time. If you run out of time, you cannot download another input file.

Re-downloading Inputs
You may re-download your input file at any time during the six-minute time period.

What are the Submission Rules and Judging?
After downloading the input file, you will have six minutes to submit the output (along with your source code). There is only one input file, but you can submit as many times as you wish during the six minutes. Your last submission within the time limit counts as your final answer. You will find out if your answer was correct after the contest.

*Note: You may experience latency issues between your computer and our servers and are therefore advised to submit with an adequate amount of time remaining in your six-minute period.

How We Will Judge Your Submission
1.	Minor differences in whitespace are ignored. In particular, every non-empty sequence of whitespace characters (except newlines and non-ASCII characters) is treated as a single space. Unix, Mac and Windows endlines are all acceptable ways of ending lines.
2.	Leading and trailing whitespace on each line is ignored. The remaining, non-empty lines are compared pairwise, using rules 1 and 3.
3.	Two floating point numbers are considered equal if their absolute or relative difference is smaller than 1e-6, unless the problem statement says otherwise. This does not apply to integers. Two integers are considered equal only when they are exactly equal.

Source Code Submission Rules
You must upload all source code used to solve each input set as part of the submission of your solution. You cannot submit your source code files after the contest. At the end of the contest, any user can view all of the source code submitted. Both the administrators and other contestants should be able to reproduce your output using your source code.

Deliberately obfuscated source code and empty source code files are not allowed. Facebook reserves the right to disqualify any submissions that we believe do not comply with the rules.

After a round, if Facebook discovers that someone submitted source code that doesn't match the submitted output (including if you tell us that your source code doesn't match), Facebook judges will look at that code, look at other code submitted by that user, and determine whether a discrepancy exists. If a discrepancy does exist we will determine whether it is a trivial discrepancy, or a non-trivial discrepancy. If there is no discrepancy, nothing happens. If there is a trivial discrepancy, the contestant will receive five penalty minutes but will keep his or her point for that problem. If there is a non-trivial discrepancy, the contestant will lose credit for that problem.

File Type for Source Code
You must submit plain text or zipped plain text for the source files. The maximum file size that you can upload is 100kB. You can upload multiple files, or you can upload a zipped source code file as long as the contents do not exceed 1MB.

Solving Problems by Hand
If you solve a problem either fully or partly by hand, please submit a text file explaining that you solved the problem by hand. We reserve the right to disqualify any submissions that we believe do not comply with the rules.

Solving problems using methods other than a programming language
If you use specific software to solve a problem, specify this in the file. That software is held to the same restrictions as compilers and interpreters as described above. Also, please provide any input scripts you wrote for the software used (e.g., mathematical software scripts, spreadsheets, etc.).

The program does not necessarily need to produce the output automatically, so it can be interactive. If you wrote an interactive command line script, you should submit all commands used to solve the problem, e.g. a linux command line with awk, Hugs commands, Octave interpreter commands, shell commands, etc.

Solving problems using several programs
If you used several programs to solve a problem, even user-assisted programs, please submit all of the programs.

Solving problems using standard and non-standard libraries
You may use standard libraries, such as Boost, and other open source libraries. If you use a publicly available library, you may submit a link to the library's website rather than including the contents of the library in your source code submission.

You also may use code from non-standard libraries, such as coding libraries from your school's ACM ICPC team, as long as you have a license to use them. You will need to upload all code used in solving each input/output set, whether you are using standard or non-standard libraries. If the source code and the zipped version of the library are larger than 1MB, you may provide a link to the library as long as the library is accessible after the contest.
