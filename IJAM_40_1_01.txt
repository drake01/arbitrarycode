Abstract—In this paper, we present a simple and
fast method for counting the number of nonnegative
integer solutions to the equality a1 x1 +a2 x2 +. . .+ar xr =
n where a1 , a2 , ..., ar and n are positive integers. As an
application, we use the method for ﬁnding the number
of solutions of a Diophantine inequality.
Keywords: Counting, Nonnegative integer solutions,
Diophantine inequality.

Introduction

Counting techniques play an important role in computing probabilities in random experiments of throwing dice,
or classical occupancy problems. As a result, they have
come to form a major part of the mathematics curriculum
in many statistical publications. First we will consider
some important applications of counting techniques.
Ross [3] showed that the number of ways for placing n
identical objects into the r distinct cells is equivalent to
the number of nonnegative integer solutions to the equation
x1 + x2 + . . . + xr = n (with xi ≥ 0, i = 1, . . . , r). (1)
He also showed that the number of positive integers solutions of (1) is n−1 . The number of nonnegative integer
r−1
solutions of (1), subject to the constraint xi ≥ bi for
i = 1, . . . , r is n+r−(b1 +b2 +...+br )−1 . Letting xi = yi + bi
r−1
for each i yields the equation
y1 + . . . + yr = n − (b1 + b2 + . . . + br ),

to be solved in nonnegative integers. The number of such
solutions where xi ≤ bi (i = 1, . . . , r) can be obtained using the inclusion/exclusion principle (see, for example,
Rosen et al. [1]). For the latter situation, Murty [4] obtained a simple method of counting the favoured number

of solutions. One generalization of (1) is the number of
nonnegative integer solutions of the following equation,
a1 x1 + a2 x2 + . . . + ar xr = n.

(3)

Equation (3) is well-known as a Linear Diophantine
Equation. As is discussed above for the simple case, it is
possible to obtain the number solutions of equation (1)
with some bounds on xi ’s from (1) without any bounds
on xi ’s. It has been shown that the number solutions of
(3) by some bounds on xi ’s can be expressed as a function of the number solutions of (3) without any bounds
on xi ’s (Eisenbeis et al. [5]). Therefore, it is enough to
restrict our eﬀort to determine the number solutions of
(3) without any bounds on xi ’s. Given positive integers
a1 , a2 , . . . , ar that are relatively prime, it is well-known
that for all suﬃciently large n the equation (3) has a solution with nonnegative integers xi (Tripathi [2]). The
generating function of equation (3) has the form
ϕ(t) = [(1 − ta1 )(1 − ta2 ) . . . (1 − tar )]−1 ,
and the number of non-negative integer solutions J(n) of
equation (2) is given by the formula:
J(n) =

1 n
ϕ (0).
n!

(4)

Calculation of J(n) is diﬃcult in most situations. Antimirov and Matvejevs, in [6] have discussed several possible methods methods for its calculation. Eisenbeis et
al.(1992) [5] presented fast methods for computing the
exact or approximate number of solutions. In summary,
there are two main problem for ﬁnding the number of
nonnegative integer solution solutions of (3); the present
methods, owing to the diﬃculty of the problem, are complicated, time consuming, and encounter diﬃculties when
one wishes to extract a list of such solutions. These issues motivated us to obtain a simple method for ﬁnding
the number of nonnegative integer solutions of (3) and
provide a list of the obtained solutions.

New Method

Among the two problems considered, i.e., computing the
number solutions and generating the solutions, the ﬁrst
one is by far the most complex. Therefore, it is vital

to simplify the problem as much as possible in order to
obtain eﬃcient computation. Let us ﬁrst consider ai = 1
for i = 2, ..., r in (3). In this case, we must ﬁnd the
number of nonnegative integer solutions for

s(a1 , . . . , ar ; n) :=
[n/a1 ] [(n−a1 w1 )/a2 ] [(n−a1 w1 −...−ar−2 wr−2 )/ar−1 ]

is the number of nonnegative integer solutions for equation (5), where [u] is the integer part of u and r is a
positive integer and r > 2. If r = 2 we must use

Let us now brieﬂy consider the characteristic of the
Diophantine Inequality (for more information see, for
example, [16][17][18][19]). The main statement of the
aforementioned theorem is in the language of lattices in
number theory. That is for any convex set in the rdimensional Euclidean space Rr symmetric with respect
to the origin, and with volume greater than 2r , must contain a lattice point other than that of the origin. In the
language of linear forms the problem is restated as
r

aij xj = Li (X), 1 ≤ i ≤ r,

j=1

Continuing the procedure, we can get the following formula for the number of nonnegative integer solutions of
(3).

with i=1 bi ≥ det(aij ). Then there exists an integer

vector C such that Li (C) ≤ bi , 1 ≤ i ≤ r, thus implying that a solution exists for the above equations and
indeed the implied inequality. The paper by Cheema,
[13] suggests techniques similar to the programming of
this research in its working, and indeed uses Minkowski’s
theorem to state that, where || · || denotes the distance
of a number from its nearest integer, that there always
exists a nonzero integer-vector solution X = (x1 , . . . , xr )
to the inequalities:
||Lj (X)|| ≤ C, (1 ≤ j ≤ r).

[7]. Padberg [12] considered the following lower bound

r! i=1 ai

Very soon after [14] was submitted, Padberg took its result in [12] and sharpened Beged-Dov’s result to the following inequality:

(16)

Another practical application of the discussed problem is
that of the “Knapsack” model, encountered in many areas
with a cleat explanation oﬀered in [14]; “the question of
how to ﬁll a knapsack of limited weight capacity with
diﬀerent items which best meet the needs of one’s trip”.
Beged-Dov [14], ﬁrst introduced bounds on the number,

These bounds were obtained in the following way. Denote
the rectangular box B(y1 , . . . , yr ) as the set of points Y =
(y1 , . . . , yr ) such that

Then as above, taking a vector ξ ∈ P (n + δ), then summing over each element of the vector we have (since
[x] ≤ x, ∀x > 0):
r

ai xi ≤ yi ≤ (xi + 1)ai for i = 1, . . . , r

(18)

which has r-dimensional volume i=1 ai . Secondly, der
ﬁne the pyramid P (n) with volume n , which denotes
r!
the set of points satisfying yi ≥ 0 for i = 1, . . . , r and
r
i=1 yi ≤ n. The bounds are obtained as a consequence
of the fact that each point xi as deﬁned above belongs
y
to a unique B, which is the one with xi = ai , and
i
if that xi lies in the pyramid P (n), then it necessarily
obeys the linear diophantine inequality in question. So
the union of the N boxes contains P (n). This somewhat
simple topological argument allows the derivation of the
above bounds. To add weight to Beged-Dov’s argument
in [14], some experimental results are calculated using an
algorithm which could be considered to be an early precursor to the results of this paper. The tendency of the
upper and lower bounds of the number of solutions to
the linear Diophantine inequality to become close with
increased number of variables and right hand side is also
touched upon.
Padberg and Lambe sought to respectively improve upon
Beged-Dov’s bounds. In the latter case an approximate
number of solutions was eventually sought and found in

(n + δ)r

substitution of P (n + δ) with P (n) in the previous proof,
which is then sharpened by taking the limit of this bound
as δ → 1. The result is improved further by making the
above substitution for a∗ and a∗∗ above, noting that

The paper of Padberg also introduces the formula for
the number of possible partitions explored in this paper,
and quotes that another proof is mentioned in the book
[15]. Lambe in his paper [11] of 1974 introduced bounds
which in most cases were better still, than what had been
previously discussed:

where a = i=1 ai . His new bounds were also able to

show that the ratio of upper to lower bounds tends to
unity as r and n grow large. To attain the lower bound,
the inequalities
g−1
i=1

yi ≤ n,

with the yi ’s all integers and g ∈ {1, . . . r + 1} are considered. The proof requires - where Pi denotes the number
of feasible (that is, nonnegative) solutions to (25) - the
proving of
Pg ≤ ag Pg+1 , for g = 1, . . . , r.

The proof of the upper bound is achieved using the inequalities

and requires the assertion - where Qi denotes the number

As mentioned above, Lambe in [7], discovered upper and
lower bounds for this number. However, the algorithm
proposed here is able to compute the exact number of
solutions. To do this, we convert (14) to (3) by adding
an extra nonnegative integer variable xr to (14). Then
we need to solve a1 x1 + . . . + ar−1 xr−1 + xr = n and
using the algorithm the number of nonnegative integer
solutions to (14) is:
s(a1 , . . . , ar−1 , 1; n) =
[(n−a1 x1 −...−ar−2 xr−2 )/ar−1 ]

Both are achieved in similar fashion.

The lower and upper bounds on the number of solutions
to this inequality, 4 and 455 respectively, are obtained
from the algorithm of (20), whilst we know the exact
number of solution is 97. It can be seen easily that these
bounds represent a wide deviation from the actual number of solutions. Let us now use the proposed algorithm
for solving (30). As we mentioned above, ﬁrst we need
to reform (30) to 10x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 12. Thus, the
solution is as follows
